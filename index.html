            Hey! I'm Taylor, and I'm a third year CS major at Tech. I'm
            originally from the Washington DC area, but I've been in Atlanta for
            so long it feels more like home than anywhere else.

            In my free time I love to play ultimate frisbee and listen to live
            music! The community that comes with the sport is so welcoming and
            laidback which I really enjoy. My team is such an admirable and
            capable group of women. The most recent show I've been to was the
            Magic City Hippies performing at the Georgia Theatre in Athens!

            <summary>Read my rant :))))))</summary>
        <p>
          A topic related to social good that I'm passionate about is the right
          to housing. I've only been renting for a few years now but the market
          and subsequent access to housing in the US over the past decade has
          changed immensely and in the wrong direction. It's a complicated
          issue, as the solution unfortuntely isn't simply to build more houses.
        </p>
        <p>
          One aspect is the gentrification of urban areas and the displacement
          of long-time residents of the community that often occurs as a result.
          Not only is this a disservice to those who have created the very
          culture that is now valued in these areas, but it also makes the city
          as a whole more exclusive to the wealthy. Building new affordable
          housing along with restaurants, retail, and other desireable features
          is essential to allow for the rejuvenation of low-income areas while
          maintaining most of the current population and upholding access to
          safe housing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another part of the issue is the commodification of housing by both
          large property management companies as well as individual homeowners.
          Landlords do not provide any kind of beneficial service and do not
          contribute to the general wellbeing or betterment of society. The
          hoarding of a profile of rental properties is a massive ethical
          violation that only perpetuates the poor maintenance of homes and thus
          lower standards of living. This also feeds into the widening wealth
          gap in the US that keeps money in the hands of the rich and basic
          necessities out of the hands of everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't claim to have all the answers to solving this issue, but I
          believe that housing should be limited to one per person/household and
          largely subsidized by the government so that individuals are only
          paying for the maintenance and recurring utility costs to live in the
          home. Homelessness is an issue we choose to have by prioritizing
          capitalist interests over human rights.
